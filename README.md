# Bedrock Module API

Bedrock is Mochi's service bootstrapping mechanism.
For documentations and tutorials, please see
[here](https://mochi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bedrock.html).

This repository contains only the headers an a library necessary
for Mochi components to provide a Bedrock module without having
to install Bedrock itself.
